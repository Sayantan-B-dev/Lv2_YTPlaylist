This is a demo web app for practicing mongoDB with Express.

you can even use it as your todo list.

change UI as you like and add functionalities as you want.
you can add,update,delete lists here and thats it for now ..i might make it more great letter like arrenging and stuff
matter of fact i might make it a complete todo web app

because after learning CRUD and mongodb with this mini project i moved to a bigger project where im working on same but more organized and big concept that involves real world data
